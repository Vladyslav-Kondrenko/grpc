# CSV Service Specification (for practical project #2)

Implement a REST API for storing product information. The "product" entity has the following structure:

```go
CREATE TABLE products (
   id serial not null unique,
   name varchar(255) not null unique,
   price integer not null default 0
)
```

## Endpoints

- **POST /products -** create a product
- **PUT /products/:id -** update a product by id
- **DELETE /products/:id -** delete a product by id
- **GET /products -** get a CSV file with the list of all products

The CSV file must have the following format:

```go
PRODUCT NAME;PRICE
```
