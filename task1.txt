## Task Overview

You need to implement 2 applications: a gRPC client and a gRPC server.

The server must accept a request from the client `Fetch(url string)`, where `url` is a link to the API endpoint of a service that returns a CSV file. When this request is received, it must fetch the current data in .csv format from the given URL and create or update product information in the MongoDB database.

The second gRPC method `List(<paging params>, <sorting params>)` accepts custom structures with parameters for sorting and pagination.

[Service for creating products and saving CSV file](http://164.92.251.245:8080/swagger/index.html)

### These 2 items may be ignored:

> Support all sorting options for implementing the interface with infinite scroll.
>

> The server must be run in 2+ instances (each in its own Docker container) behind a load balancer; the corresponding configuration must also be provided for the test environment.

💡 When completing the assignment, try to create as many new product entries as possible using `POST /api/v1/products` and update existing products (`PUT /api/v1/products/:id`).
